# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Built a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world transactional data. Applied techniques like undersampling, feature scaling, and implemented models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests for accurate classification.
This project enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, model evaluation, and handling imbalanced datasets â€” crucial aspects in fraud analytics.
